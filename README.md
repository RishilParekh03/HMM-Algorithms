# Hidden Markov Model (HMM) Algorithm Implementation

**This repository contains an implementation of a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to solve the likelihood and decoding
problems
using the Forward and Viterbi algorithms, respectively.**

## Overview

Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are statistical models that represent systems where an observed sequence of event is
produced by a hidden process. HMMs are widely used in various fields, including natural language processing,
bioinformatics, and speech recognition.

## Algorithms

### Forward Algorithm

The Forward algorithm is used to compute the probability of an observed sequence given an HMM. This is useful for the
likelihood problem.

### Viterbi Algorithm

The Viterbi algorithm is used to decode the most likely sequence of hidden states for a given observation sequence. This
helps solve the decoding problem.
